\section{Introduction}

The digital divide continues to exclude billions of people from accessing advanced language technologies, particularly in regions with limited internet connectivity. While cloud-based translation services like Google Translate have revolutionized communication, their dependency on stable internet connections renders them inaccessible in many rural and remote areas worldwide. This challenge is particularly acute for speakers of low-resource languages, where limited digital resources compound the accessibility problem.

Building upon the foundational work of Watt et al. \cite{original-paper}, who demonstrated the feasibility of edge-based translation for Hausa-English language pairs, this paper presents a comprehensive web-based implementation that addresses key limitations of command-line translation systems. Our primary contributions include: (1) development of a Flask-based web interface that democratizes access to neural machine translation, (2) implementation of a modular architecture supporting multiple language pairs including Hausa-English and English-Snejag, (3) integration of user feedback mechanisms through correction systems and diagnostic tools, and (4) comprehensive performance evaluation demonstrating the system's viability for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

The system architecture prioritizes accessibility and usability while maintaining the computational efficiency required for edge deployment. Through systematic evaluation on Raspberry Pi hardware, we demonstrate that modern web technologies can be effectively integrated with neural machine translation models to create practical solutions for multilingual communities in low-connectivity regions.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Edge Computing for NLP}

Edge computing has emerged as a promising solution for bringing AI capabilities closer to users, particularly in scenarios where cloud connectivity is limited or unreliable. Recent advances in model compression and knowledge distillation have made it feasible to deploy sophisticated NLP models on resource-constrained devices \cite{edge-nlp-survey}.

The original edge NLP translation system by Watt et al. demonstrated the feasibility of deploying LSTM-based translation models on Raspberry Pi hardware, achieving 91\% accuracy for Hausa-English translation with a BLEU score of 73.5. However, the original system was limited to command-line operation and supported only a single language pair.

\subsection{Low-Resource Language Translation}

Low-resource languages present unique challenges in neural machine translation due to limited training data and computational resources. Recent work has shown that transfer learning and multilingual models can improve translation quality for such languages \cite{low-resource-mt}. The inclusion of Snejag, a previously unexplored language pair in MT research, contributes to the growing body of work on endangered and low-resource languages.

\subsection{Web-Based Translation Interfaces}

Modern translation systems increasingly rely on web interfaces to provide user-friendly access to translation capabilities. The design of effective translation interfaces must balance functionality with simplicity, particularly for users in low-connectivity environments where interface responsiveness is crucial \cite{web-translation-interfaces}.

\section{System Architecture}

\subsection{Overall Architecture}

Figure \ref{fig:architecture} illustrates the enhanced system architecture, which consists of three main components: the neural translation engine, the web interface layer, and the edge deployment framework.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\end{figure}

The system architecture follows a modular design that separates concerns between the translation engine, web interface, and hardware abstraction layers. This design enables easy maintenance and future extensions while maintaining optimal performance on resource-constrained hardware.

\subsection{Neural Translation Engine}

The translation engine extends the original LSTM-based architecture to support multiple language pairs simultaneously. Each language pair is represented by a separate model with its own tokenizers and configuration parameters. The system currently supports three language pairs:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Hausa-English (original baseline)
    \item English-Bidaio-Jagoi
    \item Bidaio-Jagoi-English
\end{itemize}

The models are implemented using Keras with TensorFlow backend, optimized for edge deployment through model quantization and pruning techniques. Each model maintains the original LSTM architecture with encoder-decoder structure but with language-specific vocabulary sizes and sequence lengths.

\subsection{Web Interface Layer}

The web interface is implemented using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework suitable for edge deployment. The interface provides the following key features:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Real-time translation with automatic language detection
    \item Character counting and input validation
    \item Translation history management
    \item Correction mechanism for improving translation quality
    \item Diagnostic tools for system monitoring

\end{itemize}

The application implements RESTful API endpoints for translation requests, with JSON-based communication between frontend and backend. The system includes automatic error recovery and graceful degradation mechanisms to handle hardware constraints.

\subsection{Data Management and Storage}

The system implements several data management strategies:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Translation History}: Local storage of translation requests and results
