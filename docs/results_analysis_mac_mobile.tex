This paper presents a comprehensive study of a web-based neural machine translation system deployed on cloud infrastructure, covering both system implementation and cross-platform performance analysis. The system implements a Flask-based web application providing translation services for multiple language pairs, including Hausa-English and English-Snejag, deployed on Render platform's free tier (256MB RAM, shared CPU). We conduct a detailed performance analysis comparing system behavior when accessed from desktop (Mac) and mobile (Android) devices. The implementation serves as a proof-of-concept for accessing pre-trained translation models from various devices including Raspberry Pi, mobile devices, and desktop computers. Our performance evaluation reveals significant platform variations, with desktop achieving 7.15x faster response times (830.6ms vs 5942.2ms) despite consistent server-side resource consumption.

\section{Introduction}

Neural machine translation systems typically require substantial computational resources, presenting challenges for widespread accessibility. This work presents a comprehensive study combining system implementation and performance analysis of a web-based neural machine translation system deployed on free-tier cloud infrastructure.

Building upon existing work in neural machine translation, particularly the Hausa-English translation models, this paper presents both the development of a Flask-based web interface and its detailed performance analysis across different client platforms. Our contributions include: (1) development of a basic Flask-based web interface deployed on Render cloud platform free tier (256MB RAM, shared CPU) as a demonstration of neural machine translation deployment, (2) implementation of a straightforward architecture supporting multiple pre-trained language pairs including Hausa-English and English-Snejag, (3) integration of basic user feedback mechanisms through correction systems and diagnostic tools, (4) comprehensive cross-platform performance analysis comparing desktop and mobile access patterns, and (5) identification of platform-specific bottlenecks and optimization strategies for web-based neural machine translation services.

The system architecture prioritizes simplicity and basic functionality while leveraging cloud infrastructure to provide access across different client devices. Through detailed performance analysis across multiple platforms, we demonstrate both the possibilities and limitations of deploying neural machine translation models on resource-constrained infrastructure, revealing significant performance variations that impact user experience and requiring platform-specific optimization strategies.

\section{System Architecture and Implementation}

\subsection{Overall Architecture}

The system follows a client-server architecture with three main components: pre-trained translation models, a Flask web application, and cloud hosting infrastructure. The architecture separates the web interface from the translation logic, enabling maintainability while operating within the constraints of free-tier cloud hosting.

The translation system operates on a client-server architecture with the following components:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Server: Linux x86\_64 backend running Python 3.11.11
    \item Models: Pre-trained neural translation models (Hausa-English, English-Snejag, Snejag-English)
    \item Cloud Platform: Render free tier (256MB RAM, shared CPU)
    \item Web Framework: Flask-based Python application
    \item Frontend: Responsive HTML/CSS/JavaScript interface
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Translation Models}

The system uses pre-trained LSTM-based translation models for three language pairs. The models are implemented using Keras with TensorFlow backend, with optimizations to fit within memory constraints.

Table \ref{tab:model-specs} shows the specifications for each language model.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Model Specifications for Each Language Pair}
\label{tab:model-specs}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lccc@{}}
\toprule
Language Pair & Vocab Size & Max Seq Len & Model Size (MB) \\
\midrule
Hausa-English & 1014/977 & 89/72 & 24.3 \\
English-Snejag & 1860/1756 & 73/89 & 28.7 \\
Snejag-English & 1756/1860 & 89/73 & 27.1 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Web Interface Implementation}

The web interface is implemented using Flask, providing a simple and accessible translation service. The interface includes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Translation form with language pair selection
    \item Character counting and input validation
    \item Translation history with local storage
    \item Correction mechanism for user feedback
    \item Diagnostic tools for system monitoring
    \item Performance metrics collection
\end{itemize}

The frontend uses standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) with responsive design optimized for both desktop and mobile accessibility.

\subsection{Cloud Deployment Architecture}

The deployment leverages Render cloud platform's free tier, providing:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 256MB RAM allocation for model loading and processing
    \item Shared CPU resources with variable performance
    \item Automatic scaling within free-tier limits
    \item HTTPS deployment with custom domain support
    \item Integrated logging and monitoring capabilities
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Collection and Analysis}

Performance metrics were collected during two separate test sessions on July 19, 2025:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Session 1: Mac desktop access via Safari 18.5 (217.3 seconds duration)
    \item Session 2: Android mobile access via Chrome 138.0 (155.3 seconds duration)
\end{itemize}

Each session included multiple translation requests with comprehensive monitoring of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Server resource utilization (CPU, memory, temperature)
    \item Client-side performance metrics (page load, rendering)
    \item Network characteristics and latency
    \item User interaction patterns and behavior
    \item Translation response times and throughput
\end{itemize}

Data collection employed both server-side monitoring tools and client-side JavaScript performance APIs to capture comprehensive performance profiles.

\section{Performance Analysis Results}

\subsection{Translation Performance Comparison}

Table \ref{tab:translation-performance} presents the core translation performance metrics across desktop and mobile platforms, revealing significant performance variations.

\begin{table}[htbp]

The cross-platform performance analysis reveals critical insights into the behavior of web-based neural machine translation systems across different client environments. The 7.15× performance difference between desktop (830.6ms) and mobile (5942.2ms) access demonstrates the significant impact of client-side factors, network conditions, and browser implementations on user experience.

Server-side resource utilization remains remarkably consistent across platforms (39.5\% vs 43.1\% CPU utilization), confirming that performance variations originate primarily from client-side and network factors rather than server processing capabilities. This insight is crucial for optimization strategies and resource allocation decisions.
